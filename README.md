# 💸 BudgetBuddy – Student Budgeting Made Simple  
**Designed at the Fall 2024 UI/UX Designathon Competition | UT Dallas**  
📅 *November 9–10, 2024*

---

## 🧠 Introduction  
**BudgetBuddy** is a smart, student-centric budgeting assistant designed during the **Fall 2024 UI/UX Designathon on November 9th through November 10th at the University of Texas at Dallas**. Our goal: empower students to take control of their finances through a beautifully simple, AI-enhanced app experience tailored for college life.

The project was built in **Figma** and grounded in real student feedback to simulate the full product lifecycle—from problem discovery and feature prioritization to design and future roadmap definition.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Students face a common challenge: managing finances with irregular income (from part-time jobs, scholarships, etc.) and impulsive spending habits. Most budgeting tools on the market are either too complex or not designed for student life.
